Oppose the motion. “Strict” ex ante laws for LLMs are the wrong tool for a fast-moving, general‑purpose technology. They would freeze today’s assumptions into tomorrow’s handcuffs, entrench incumbents who can afford compliance, and export innovation—and oversight—to less scrupulous jurisdictions, all while creating a checkbox illusion of safety.

- Target harms, not the tool. Fraud, discrimination, privacy abuse, cybercrime, biothreats, election manipulation—these are already illegal. Enforce existing law against bad actors and high‑risk uses, rather than imposing blanket rules on math models that power everything from accessibility tools to medical research.

- Regulate deployment, not research. In high‑stakes domains, hold deployers to sector standards (medical, finance, education) with outcome‑based requirements and liability if things go wrong. That aligns accountability with control, without pre‑clearing every model or throttling open research.

- Strictness backfires. Mandated audits, compute reporting, and kill‑switches sound prudent but quickly become: a) obsolete checklists gamed by vendors; b) surveillance of legitimate researchers; c) single points of failure and political leverage over speech. Watermarking mandates are brittle and trivial to strip—false security that chills legitimate expression.

- “Scale, opacity, speed” aren’t unique to LLMs. We didn’t solve internet risks by licensing compilers; we built resilient systems: authentication for sensitive actions, platform guardrails, post‑market monitoring, and rapid incident response. Adaptive governance beats static statutes.

- Market failure cuts both ways. Heavy compliance is a subsidy to giants, crushing startups, academics, and open‑source communities that actually improve safety via scrutiny and rapid patching. The surest path to concentrated power over “knowledge and attention” is to require only a handful of firms to hold the keys.

- Rights and data dignity don’t require LLM‑specific strict laws. Enforce privacy, IP, and consumer protection we already have; modernize them where needed. Let licensing markets, collective bargaining for creators, and provenance standards develop—without criminalizing or freezing benign training and fair use.

- Trust comes from performance, not permits. Buyers want transparent capabilities, post‑deployment audits, incident reporting, and insurance-backed guarantees. These tools evolve as the tech does; statutes don’t.

A better path:
- Use‑based, sector‑specific obligations and liability for deployers in sensitive contexts.
- Transparent disclosures, independent red‑teaming, and post‑market incident reporting via standards and safe harbors, not rigid mandates.
- Strong enforcement of existing fraud, privacy, IP, election, and cyber laws; tougher penalties for AI‑scaled abuse.
- Procurement and insurance to set de facto, updatable safety baselines.
- International, nonbinding technical standards (NIST/ISO) that can adapt on quarterly—not legislative—timescales.

Progress needs steering, yes—but strict, one‑size laws will lock the wheel while the road keeps turning. Regulate harmful uses and outcomes, keep accountability with deployers, and let flexible standards—not rigid statutes—deliver safety without sacrificing innovation and open inquiry.
