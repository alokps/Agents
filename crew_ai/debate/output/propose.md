Motion: There needs to be strict laws to regulate LLMs.

Strict laws are necessary because LLMs combine three risk multipliers—scale, opacity, and speed—that markets alone cannot control.

- Public safety and national security: LLMs can generate convincing disinformation, enable large-scale fraud and social engineering, and lower barriers to cyber and bio misuse. When a single system can instantly tailor manipulation for millions, “move fast and fix later” becomes reckless; harms scale faster than remedies.

- Market failure is baked in: Developers are rewarded for deployment and virality, not verifiable safety. Externalities (privacy breaches, IP theft, deepfakes, bias) are borne by the public. Asymmetric information means buyers and users can’t evaluate model limits or risks. This is the textbook case for regulation.

- Rights and dignity: These systems are trained on people’s data and creative work without clear consent, provenance, or redress. Strict laws can enforce data rights, audit trails, and compensation—basic fairness, not optional courtesy.

- Accountability and due process: In high-stakes domains (health, finance, education, justice), hallucinations and bias aren’t “bugs,” they’re liabilities. We already demand seatbelts, drug trials, and building codes; comparable assurance for LLMs—pre-deployment testing, independent audits, incident reporting, and clear liability—protects the public and responsible innovators alike.

- Democracy and information integrity: A handful of firms now mediate knowledge and attention. Without guardrails—watermarking, election-related safeguards, and transparency—LLMs can distort public discourse at unprecedented scale. Democratic societies regulate institutions with this much influence.

- Innovation thrives on trust: Clear, strict rules reduce uncertainty, set a level playing field, and unlock adoption in regulated sectors. Seatbelts didn’t kill cars; they mainstreamed them. Smart strictness is a competitive advantage.

What “strict” should mean:
- Risk-tiered regulation with escalating obligations for more capable or open-weight models.
- Mandatory safety evaluations and red-teaming before and after release; third-party audits and model cards.
- Data governance: consent, provenance, opt-out, and compensation mechanisms.
- Secure deployment: watermarking/content provenance, identity verification for high-risk tools, and abuse monitoring.
- Compute and incident reporting to a competent regulator; kill-switches for catastrophic failure modes.
- Clear liability and penalties; compliance safe harbors to reward best practices.
- Bright-line bans on specific dangerous uses (e.g., autonomous bio/cyber offense).

Self-regulation has repeatedly failed in tech. With LLMs, the costs of failure are systemic and irreversible. Strict laws are not a brake on progress; they are the steering and the brakes that keep progress on the road.
