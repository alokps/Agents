Subject: Faster SOC 2 readiness for [Company] — automated, audit-ready, AI-powered

Hi [CTO Name],

When you’re balancing product velocity with growing security and compliance demands, SOC 2 prep can quickly become a full-time distraction. At ComplAI we help mid‑market tech companies cut the time and uncertainty around SOC 2 readiness and audits by automating evidence collection, controls mapping, and auditor‑ready reporting — powered by AI.

A few ways ComplAI helps teams like yours:
- Automated evidence collection and continuous monitoring across cloud and dev tools (AWS/GCP, GitHub, Okta, Slack, etc.).
- AI-driven gap analysis and prioritized remediation steps so engineering and security focus on what matters.
- One-click, auditor-ready reports and documentation to shorten review cycles and reduce back-and-forth.

If you’re planning a Type I or Type II audit (or want continuous SOC 2 assurance), I can show how ComplAI typically reduces prep overhead and speeds auditor handoffs without adding headcount.

Are you available for a 15-minute demo next week? I’m free Tuesday 10–11am or Wednesday 2–3pm — if those don’t work, tell me a better time and I’ll send a calendar invite.

Thanks for your time,

Subject: Make SOC2 audits suck less — 15-minute readiness scan?

Hi [FirstName],

Quick one — is SOC2 still your team’s favorite recurring party-crasher? (No prizes for guessing the answer.)

I’m [Your Name] at ComplAI. We built an AI-powered SOC2 platform that turns audit panic into paint-by-numbers: automated evidence collection, continuous control monitoring, and audit-ready reports you can hand an auditor without a guilt trip.

What we do for mid-sized tech orgs:
- Auto-collect evidence from AWS/GCP/Azure, GitHub, Jira, Okta, SSO, logs, etc.
- Continuous drift detection + alerts so controls don’t quietly fail
- AI-driven control mapping and policy templates to cut manual work
- One-click audit bundles that auditors actually like

Customers like yours tell us they go from weeks of prep to days, and shave hours off auditor time — which usually means fewer all-hands about “where are the PDFs.”

If you’re open, I’ll run a free, no-install SOC2 readiness scan for your environment and send the results — 10–15 minutes to set up, zero commitment. I’m free Tue 10–11am PT or Thu 2–3pm PT — which works, or tell me a better time.

Cheers,
[Your Name]

Our AI-powered platform:
- Automatically maps controls to your stack (Okta, AWS, GitHub, Slack, G Suite, etc.)
- Collects auditor-ready evidence and generates policies and remediation steps

We’ve helped mid-market SaaS teams shift SOC 2 prep from a months‑long drain to an engineer-minimal process.
