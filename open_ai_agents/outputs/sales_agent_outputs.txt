Subject: Cut SOC 2 audit prep time — a 15-minute readiness review

Hi [CTO Name],

I’m [Your Name], Head of Growth at ComplAI. We help mid-sized tech companies simplify SOC 2 compliance with an AI-driven platform that automates evidence collection, maps controls to your existing stack, and produces auditor-ready artifacts.

If you’re preparing for SOC 2—or trying to reduce ongoing audit overhead—ComplAI can help by:
- Automatically collecting and organizing evidence from AWS/GCP/Azure, GitHub, Okta, Jira, Slack, etc.
- Continuously monitoring controls and surfacing prioritized remediation suggestions
- Generating auditor-ready reports and control test results to shorten prep cycles

I’d like to offer a complimentary 15-minute SOC 2 readiness review of your current approach (no sales pitch, just actionable findings). Are you available Tuesday or Thursday next week at 10:00 AM PT? If not, reply with a time that works and I’ll accommodate.

Regards,

Subject: Make SOC 2 less soul-crushing (15 min to see how)

Hi [FirstName],

Quick question: would you rather wrestle a 500-line Terraform drift report or have SOC 2 prep handled by something that actually understands your stack?

I’m [Your Name] from ComplAI. We built an AI-powered SOC 2 compliance platform that saves engineering teams from the endless evidence-chasing, spreadsheet gymnastics, and late-night “what did the auditor ask for?” panics.

Why CTOs at mid-sized tech companies like yours try ComplAI:
- Auto-collect evidence across GitHub, AWS/GCP, Okta, Jira, Slack, and more — no auditors > developers > emails > repeat.
- Continuous control monitoring and alerting so compliance isn’t a one-off panic sprint.
- Auto-generated audit packets that auditors actually like (and close faster).
- Prioritized gap analysis and remediation playbooks for your engineers — fewer meetings, more code.

What it gets you: faster audits, fewer surprise requests, and reclaiming engineering time. Customers tell us prep that used to take weeks now takes days — and auditors close faster.

If you’re up for it, I’ll run a complimentary 7-day readiness scan for [Company] and show a short demo of an auto-generated audit packet. 15 minutes — no slides, just a live peek. Are you free Tuesday at 10 AM or Thursday at 2 PM? If not, pick a time here: [Calendly link].

If SOC 2 is already your zen garden, reply and I’ll send over the funniest compliance meme I have. ;)

Cheers,
[Your Name]

P.S. We don’t pretend to replace your auditor — we just make them love you.

Subject: Cut SOC 2 prep time for [Company] by automating evidence collection

Hi [First name],

Preparing for SOC 2 audits often pulls engineers and security folks off product work—manual evidence collection, chasing logs, and rebuilding controls. That’s what we solve at ComplAI.

Quick summary:
- AI-driven evidence collection and control mapping (integrates with GitHub, AWS, Okta, Jira, etc.)
- Continuous monitoring + auditor-ready evidence packages
- Faster audit prep and fewer manual hours (customers have cut prep time by as much as 70%)

If you’re open, I can show a 15-minute demo and run one control against your stack to show how it would work for [Company]. Are you available Tue or Thu next week for 15 minutes? If another time is easier, tell me when.

Best,
[Your name]
