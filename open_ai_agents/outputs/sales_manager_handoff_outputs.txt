Subject: Cut complaint resolution time by 40% — quick question

Dear CEO,

At ComplAI we help companies cut complaint resolution time by an average of 40% using AI that categorizes, prioritizes, and suggests reply drafts for every customer issue. One enterprise client reduced churn from complaint-related cases by 18% in three months and recovered $300K in retained revenue.

If you have 15 minutes this week, I’d like to show a short before/after demo for how ComplAI could work with your team — no commitment, just a quick walkthrough. What’s the best time for a 15-minute call?

Best regards,

Subject: Turn customer complaints into a revenue opportunity (30-day pilot)

Dear CEO,

Many companies treat complaints as a cost — we see them as an opportunity. ComplAI automatically routes high-value cases, recommends personalized responses, and flags churn risks so agents act where it matters. One mid-market client ran our 30-day pilot and increased first-contact resolutions by 27%, converting several at-risk accounts back to active status.

I’d like to offer a 30-day pilot tailored to your complaint volume so you can measure impact before you buy. If you’re open, I can arrange a setup call and a custom ROI estimate. When would be a good time?

Regards,

Subject: If complaints are costing you customers — a simple fix

Dear CEO,

Quick note — complaints often hide the customers you’ll lose tomorrow. ComplAI identifies the highest-risk tickets and gives agents prioritized, proven responses so you stop avoidable churn. We typically find low-effort fixes that recover 5–10% of at-risk revenue within weeks.

I can run a free 7-day analysis on your complaint dataset and send a one-page findings report (no integration required). If the findings look useful, we can discuss next steps. Interested in the free analysis?

Thanks,

Evaluation and selection:
I reviewed all three drafts for clarity, credibility, brevity, and a clear next step. Draft 1 is the strongest: it leads with a specific, credible metric, includes social proof, and asks for a concise, easy commitment (15-minute demo). I select Draft 1 as the winning email.

Handoff to Email Manager (ONLY the winning email draft — do not include the other drafts):
