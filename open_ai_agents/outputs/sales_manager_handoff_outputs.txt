Step 1 — Drafts generated by the three sales_agent tools

Draft from sales_agent_alpha:
Subject: Reduce compliance review time without adding headcount

Dear CEO,

I’m Alice from ComplAI. We help companies automate compliance reviews with AI so your teams spend less time on manual checks and more time on strategic work. Our solution integrates with your existing systems and delivers clear, actionable reports in hours — not weeks.

If you’re open, I’d love 15 minutes to show how we can reduce your compliance review workload and free up your team this quarter. Are you available next Tuesday or Wednesday for a short call?

Best,
Alice

Draft from sales_agent_beta:
Subject: A simple way to reclaim time from manual compliance work

Dear CEO,

Alice here from ComplAI. We recently helped a mid-sized fintech replace repetitive compliance tasks with an AI-driven workflow that surfaced risks faster and freed up the team to focus on product and growth. The change improved auditability and reduced time spent on routine checks.

If you’d be interested, I can share a concise 10-minute playbook that outlines the common low-effort, high-impact automation opportunities we find at companies like yours. Would you prefer I send the playbook or schedule a quick call?

Regards,
Alice

Draft from sales_agent_gamma:
Subject: Quick, no-cost compliance health-check

Dear CEO,

I’m Alice at ComplAI. Many CEOs are surprised how much compliance processes drain engineering and ops bandwidth. We run a no-obligation 2-week assessment that identifies three immediate automation opportunities and the estimated impact — no implementation required.

Reply “Yes” if you’d like that assessment started, or tell me a better next step and I’ll follow it up.

Thanks,
Alice

Step 2 — Selection
I reviewed the three drafts. The sales_agent_alpha draft is the clearest and most concise: it states the value, mentions integration ease, provides a tight, specific CTA (15-minute call), and keeps the ask simple. I choose that one as the single best email.

Step 3 — Handoff to Email Manager
