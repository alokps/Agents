Dear CEO,

I'm Alex Park, Sales Manager at ComplAI. We help companies shorten compliance review cycles and reduce regulatory risk by automating document review, audit trails, and exception handling with an AI that plugs into your existing systems. Clients typically cut manual review time by 40–60% and accelerate onboarding and audits from days to hours.

If you're open to a brief conversation, I can show a two-slide demo and a custom estimate of potential time and cost savings for your organization. Would 15 minutes next Tuesday or Thursday morning work, or is there a better time for you?

Best regards,
Alex Park
Sales Manager, ComplAI
