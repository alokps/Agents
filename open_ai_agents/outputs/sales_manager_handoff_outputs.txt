(Using sales_agent.alpha — draft 1)
Subject: Cut complaint handling time in half — 15 minutes?

Dear CEO,

Customer complaints are one of the fastest ways revenue quietly leaks away. At ComplAI we help companies reduce complaint resolution time by up to 50% by automating triage, drafting responses, and surfacing root causes so teams can fix recurring issues.

If you’re open to a quick conversation, I’d love 15 minutes to show a short before/after using a client in your industry and outline three immediate wins you could expect in month one.

Are you available for a 15‑minute call next week? I’ll send a short, relevant agenda — no slide decks unless you want them.

Best regards,
Alice

(Using sales_agent.beta — draft 2)
Subject: How one CEO turned complaint backlog into a growth engine

Dear CEO,

When a mid-market SaaS CEO I recently spoke with saw a persistent complaint backlog, they expected churn to climb. Instead, by implementing ComplAI to automate responses and flag systemic issues, they cut resolution time by 60% and turned complaints into product-improvement tickets — reducing churn and increasing upsell conversations.

We focus on integrating with your existing support stack, training on your tone, and delivering measurable improvements within the first 30 days. No big IT project — just immediate operational relief and clearer product insights.

If this sounds useful, can I share a 10–12 minute walkthrough tailored to your team’s current tools and volume?

Warmly,
Alice

(Using sales_agent.gamma — draft 3)
Subject: Reduce complaint costs and recapture ARR

Dear CEO,

Most companies underestimate the cost of unresolved complaints: lost renewals, extra support staffing, and bad word-of-mouth. ComplAI automates complaint intake, classifies urgency, drafts reply templates customized to your voice, and routes issues to the right owner — typically reducing handling costs by ~30% and improving NPS within 60 days.

We integrate in under two weeks and can run a short pilot to demonstrate ROI on a subset of channels. If you’d like, I can prepare a custom ROI snapshot for your current complaint volume.

Would 20 minutes next week work to review a pilot plan?

Thanks,
Alice

Selection and handoff:
I reviewed all three drafts. The most concise and direct message likely to get a CEO’s attention is draft 1 (sales_agent.alpha): it states the problem, the specific benefit, and a low-friction CTA (15 minutes). I am now handing off ONLY that winning draft to the Email Manager for formatting and sending.
